Get the real key from each service using OAuth2 - Start with Strava

Change danger color in bootstrap template to a nicer one

Support more than 1 service per user
    - There is one URL to authenticate for each service
    - Single view to get service key receives service name from url and stores service name in key model
    - 'Table' of supported services with name and redirect URL (In database? constant?)

Review functional test for multiple users (Currently passing even with keys from different user)
