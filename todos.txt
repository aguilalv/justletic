Support more than 1 service per user
   - There is one URL to authenticate for each service
   - The user summary page has the user name (or email address) big and then the services she has authorised with the keys

Refactor duplication in urls.py

Get the real key from each service using OAuth2 - Start with Strava
Review functional test for multiple users (Currently passing even with keys from different user)
